# GitHub Copilot Configuration

## Automated Pull Requests - NOT WANTED

**IMPORTANT:** This repository does NOT want automated pull requests from GitHub Copilot or Copilot coding agents.

### Policy
- No automated PRs for code comparisons, refactoring suggestions, or other automated improvements
- All changes should be intentionally requested by repository maintainers
- Copilot IDE assistance is welcome, but automated PR creation is not

### For Repository Admins
To prevent unwanted Copilot automated PRs:
1. Go to Repository Settings → Copilot
2. Disable "Copilot for Pull Requests" or "Copilot Workspace" features
3. Check Settings → Rules → Rulesets to disable automatic Copilot code review
4. Review installed GitHub Apps and remove/restrict Copilot-related integrations if necessary

### History
- A PR for "copilot/compare-js-vs-typescript-time" was automatically created and was NOT wanted
- This configuration file documents our preference to prevent future occurrences
